Hello! I'm **Yifei Zhao**, a PhD student at [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am currently working under the guidance of my mentor, **Prof. Yun Lin**, in the [Data Driven Software Technology](https://ddst.sjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am specializing in protein-ligand docking, an area that combines computational biology with artificial intelligence to predict how small molecules (ligands) bind to protein targets, which is crucial for drug discovery.

## üîç<span style="color: #5f9ea0;">My Research Focus</span>
My research applies deep learning techniques to model and predict protein-ligand interactions, with the goal of accelerating the process of drug design and discovery. By leveraging AI, I aim to develop more accurate and efficient models to understand and predict the behavior of complex biological systems.

I am part of the **AI4Medicine** field within AI4Science, where cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools are used to solve pressing challenges in medicine, including drug discovery, protein folding, and disease prediction. 

For more information on this research area, you can search for AI4Science and explore further.

## üìå<span style="color: #5f9ea0;">Research Group</span>
I work under the supervision of **Prof. Yun Lin**, a professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University. He leads **CoPhi Group**, a Software Engineering research group in SJTU, whose work focuses on automated code programming, testing and debugging, visual interpretation and debugging of model training, and fraud information detection. We are now expanding our research in the field of AI4Science.
